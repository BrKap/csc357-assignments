- run "./xlat" to see usage message.
 -d with 1 set of chars for delete mode
 -d and -c with 1 set of chars for complement mode
 2 sets of chars for translation mode
- I struggled the most with making the test cases work with the allchars file.
As of writing this I still haven't been able to pass Test 55. I wasn't able to type the
whole cmd prompt in order to output the result into a file to check the difference so I
have been unable to figure out what is going wrong with my translate function to solve it.

On the bright side of things, when this is officially turned in at midnight, it will be my
birthday. So as my Birthday Gift to myself, I won't have to stress about this code :)

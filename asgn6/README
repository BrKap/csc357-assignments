I finally figured out why the pipeline was not working properly.
I had just copy pasted the struct pipeline and struct clstage from
the assignment details. However, this was causing problems and once
I decided to just remove that everything worked fine. It's a
wonder how the compiler wasn't complaining about double definitions.
The reason why the print_pipeline worked, was because it was using
the correct structs for both while my functions was using the structs
I copy pasted. So at the end of the day, my function to setup and execute
the pipeline was correct, I had just been using a bogus pipeline
definition which screwed up the whole thing. At least it's done now

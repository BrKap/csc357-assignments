- Problem 1: Fixing expressions I got wrong

1. B / A
   2 / 3 = 0
   I accidentally did A / B on the test

2. (int)&grade[4] = (int)&grade[0]
	16 - 0 = 16
	I did 4 - 0 on the test, but casting to int causes
	the address counting to be by 4 instead of 1 for each address

3. (A=1)?B:A
   A is set to 1 so the expression is always true
   Result is B which is 2
